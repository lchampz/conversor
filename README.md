simple conversor lol 

use 'npm install' to install dependecies and 'npm start' to run the project locally, remember to create a '.env' archive and put your api key on variable 'REACT_APP_ API_KEY'.

just one workout, fully available for full or partial copying :D

I will increase the number of quotes, when I hav time 

hope my code helps some newbie (like me XD)
